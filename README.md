# SpyNet AR

**A location-based espionage game where your city becomes a living spy thriller**

## Overview - Lean MVP

SpyNet AR is a **web-based spy game** that combines physical QR code treasure hunting with faction-based territory control. Players become secret agents, completing missions at real-world locations to help their faction dominate the city.

**Current Status**: Building a focused, playable MVP to validate core gameplay before investing in mobile apps and complex features.

### Core Features (MVP)
- **QR code missions** - Scan codes at physical locations using your browser
- **Territory control** - Capture zones by completing missions in that area
- **Faction warfare** - Join one of three rival agencies competing for dominance
- **Web-based** - No app install needed, works on any mobile browser
- **AI flavor text** - Mission briefings generated by AI for narrative immersion
- **Progression system** - Earn XP, ranks, and credits through gameplay

### What We're NOT Building (Yet)
- ❌ Mobile apps (iOS/Android) - web-first approach
- ❌ Augmented Reality - map-based instead
- ❌ BLE proximity detection - manual encounters only
- ❌ Real-time AI mission generation - pre-written missions
- ❌ Complex infrastructure - simple VPS deployment

These features may come later if the MVP succeeds.

## Game Concept

Players start as **Independent Operatives**, completing missions to build reputation. As they progress, rival factions recruit them into a persistent shadow war:

- **The Obsidian Order** - Masters of deception and psychological warfare
- **The Aurora Syndicate** - Tech-forward anarchists specializing in digital infiltration
- **The Citadel Directorate** - Military-precision loyalists focused on tactical operations

Players can become **double agents**, switching sides or feeding false intel. The AI mission director creates emergent narratives where every action influences the global story.

## Key Features

### Location-Based Gameplay
- AR overlay for discovering virtual items
- GPS-tracked control zones at landmarks and neighborhoods
- Real-world QR codes at bars, tourist spots, and hidden locations

### Social & Competitive
- Spot nearby agents using BLE proximity detection
- Faction-based territory control wars
- Cooperative and adversarial missions
- Player-deployed QR codes for community-driven content

### AI-Driven Narrative
- LLM orchestrates dynamic mission generation
- Personalized objectives based on player style
- Emergent storylines from player actions
- Real-time faction war adaptation

### Accessibility
- Field missions requiring physical exploration
- Remote cyber missions (decryption, analysis, puzzles)
- Strategic command roles for high-ranking agents
- Full participation regardless of mobility

## Tech Stack (Lean MVP)

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript + Web Components (no build step)
- **QR Scanning**: Browser WebRTC + jsQR library
- **Maps**: Leaflet.js (open source)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Fastify (dynamic routing)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 with PostGIS
- **Caching**: Redis 7
- **AI**: OpenAI/Local LLM for text generation (minimal usage)
- **Hosting**: Single VPS ($20/mo) with Docker Compose
- **No Kubernetes, no microservices, no complex infrastructure**
